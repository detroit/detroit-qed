detroit-qed(5) - run qed demonstrandum using detroit
====================================================

## DESCRIPTION

The QED plug-in for Detroit utilizes the QED test framework
to run tests during the standard test phase. It can also be used
to unify QED demonstrandum into a single document suitable for
inclusion in documentation.


## OPTIONS

The following options can be used in the Detroit assembly file
for defining a qed service.

  * `files` - Demonstrandum files to run (or globs there-of).

  * `omit` - File patterns to omit from `files`.

  * `format` - Output format.

  * `mode` - Parse mode.

  * `loadpath` - Paths to be added to `$LOAD_PATH`.

  * `requires` - Libraries to be required before running demonstrandum.

  * `rooted` - Operate from project root, instead of `tmp/qed`.

  * `profile` - Select a profile.


## EXAMPLES

The simplest entry is

    qed:
      files: spec/
      format: verbatim
